    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Tooba Ashfaque and I belong to Allahabad(now Prayagraj). I have completed my intermediate from PM SHRI Kendriya Vidyalaya AFS Manauri, Allahabad and am currently pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with specialization in Artificial Intelligence from KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad. I am always keen about learning new things no matter what the domain is. I'm proficient in Python and am currently learning C language and HTML.</p>

    <section id="section2">
    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about coding and working with artificial intelligence and Internet of Things. Besides these, I am into drawing, sketching and painting and hence have immense appreciation for art. I also love to read books, primarily fiction, and explore places with full of nature's essence which fill me with a peaceful sense of warmth. As for sports, I like playing kabaddi, badminton and chess though I know little about these and would love to know more in future.</p>

    <h2>My SWOC Analysis</h2>
    </section>
    <section id="section4">
    <h3>Strength and Weakness</h3>
    <p>My strength lies in my discipline, confidence and patience. I can manage stress effectively, and can handle tough situations calmly and arrive on decisions which I believe prove to be better in the future. On the other hand, I cannot trust people easily and don't tend to express my true feelings everywhere, which I am trying to work upon.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section5">
    <h3>Opportunities</h3>
    <p>I am looking for opportunities in technical field such as participating in hackathons and coding competitions, and joining a technical club as well as a few non-technical clubs for improving my soft skills.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section6">
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>Since I have only tasted a drop of coding and there is an ocean yet to explore, hence getting better at it while also managing my time effectively for other activities is a challenge for me right now. In the long run, I see increasing layoffs and shrinking job opportunities in the IT sector as a challenge.</p>
    </section>
    <br>
    <section id="section7">
    <h2>Aim and Vision</h2>
    <p>I aim to be a flawless coder as well as a skilled engineer so that I can develop impeccable solutions to some real-life problems with the help of technology while also investing my time and efforts for the welfare of humanity.</p>
